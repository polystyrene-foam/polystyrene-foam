Welcome to my GitHub profile! Pinned repos:
1. [car-axle-client-fork](https://github.com/polystyrene-foam/car-axle-client-fork): A fork of [@penguinify's](https://github.com/penguinify) [car-axle-client](https://github.com/penguinify/car-axle-client), used as an attempt to retrieve the code from the v8 version.
2. [polystyrene-foam.github.io](https://github.com/polystyrene-foam/polystyrene-foam.github.io): Repository for my website. It is currently in it's early stages while I do other projects related to learning HTML that prevent me from taking the time to update it.
3. [odin-recipes](https://github.com/polystyrene-foam/odin-recipes): This is my final project for the HTML section of the Foundations course. Also just a site for various recipes I've made. Credit to [@TheOdinProject](https://github.com/TheOdinProject) for helping me learn how to code :)
